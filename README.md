# Arbitrage
Using the Keepa and Ebay API, compare used prices of textbooks automatically.

If you would like to use this project for yourself, you need to setup your API access token.
To do this, create a file called "accesskey.py" in the same directory. Inside this file,
enter the following:

```
accesskey = "123456789_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_987654321" 
```

I did this so I wouldn't have to remember to remove my access key every
time I wanted to make a commit.
